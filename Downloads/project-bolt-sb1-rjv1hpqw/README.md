Netlify deploy logs

If you'd like me to verify the latest deploy succeeded, either:

- Paste the deploy log output here (from the Netlify Deploys tab), or
- Create a Netlify Personal Access Token (User settings → Applications → Personal access tokens) and paste it temporarily so I can fetch the latest deploy logs (I'll delete it after use). For privacy/security it's safer to paste logs yourself.

Project layout

- `project/` — Vite + React TypeScript app (run `npm run dev` inside this folder)
